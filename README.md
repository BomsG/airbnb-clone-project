# Primary Page Descriptions
 | Page Name               | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a list or grid of properties with images, price, location, rating, and basic details. Includes filtering and sorting options (e.g., by location, price, availability). |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows full information for a selected property: large image gallery, amenities, host details, reviews, and a date picker for booking. Includes a ‚ÄúReserve‚Äù or ‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù call-to-action. |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | A minimal, focused page summarizing the reservation: selected dates, cost breakdown (price, service fees, taxes), and a secure confirmation button. |


# Importance of User-Friendly Design in a Booking System
A user-friendly design is essential for a booking system because it directly affects user trust and conversion rates. Here's why:

Efficiency: Clear layouts and simple interactions help users complete bookings quickly and easily

Confidence: Visually clean and well-structured pages reduce hesitation and boost trust in the platform

Accessibility: An inclusive design ensures all users, including those with disabilities, can interact with the system

Engagement: A smooth and enjoyable experience encourages repeat usage and positive word-of-mouth

# Why Identifying Design Properties Matters
Understanding the color styles and typography defined in your Figma mockup is essential for creating a cohesive, user-friendly UI. Here‚Äôs why:

Consistency: Ensures the app looks polished and unified across all screens

Developer Efficiency: Makes it easier to translate designs into code with predefined tokens

Accessibility: Helps maintain legible contrast ratios and readable text

Brand Identity: Reinforces the visual language of the platform

Design-to-Dev Handoff: Smoothens collaboration by clearly mapping design tokens to code variables

##  UI Component Patterns

###  Planned Components

- **Navbar**  
  A responsive navigation bar that includes the logo, search bar, and user menu. It should adapt across devices and support authentication states (e.g., signed in vs. guest view).

- **Property Card**  
  Displays a preview of each listing with an image, title, location, rating, and price per night. Designed for grid layout and optimized for performance.

- **Footer**  
  Contains site-wide links like Help, Terms, Privacy, and Contact. The footer should remain clean and accessible across all pages.

- **Search Bar**  
  A location/date-based input bar with dynamic filtering for check-in, check-out, guest count, etc.

- **Listing Detail Sections**  
  Components that break down detailed views such as amenities, reviews, host info, calendar availability, and booking CTA.

- **Buttons & Badges**  
  Reusable elements like primary buttons, secondary buttons, status badges, and filters ‚Äî all following the brand color palette.

- **Modal & Dialogs**  
  Used for login/signup forms, booking confirmations, or user prompts.
